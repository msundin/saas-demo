# Development Workflows

## Workflow Modes

**Choose the workflow that matches your project phase:**

### üöÄ Rapid Mode (Prototyping / Solo / MVP)

**When to use:**
- Exploring new ideas
- Building MVP or prototype
- Solo development without users yet
- Learning new technology

**What "Rapid" means:**
- ‚ö° **Streamlined PROCESS** (no PRs, no issues, work on main)
- ‚ö° **Fast iteration** (commit and deploy frequently)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT** lower code quality or fewer tests!

**Process:**
1. Work directly on `main` branch
2. Skip GitHub issues (unless you want them for your own tracking)
3. **Write tests first** (TDD for all critical paths)
4. Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages
5. Include `#issue-number` in commits IF you created an issue
6. Auto-deploy via Vercel on every push
7. Focus on speed AND quality

**Quality Standards (SAME as Production Mode):**
- ‚úÖ 80%+ test coverage
- ‚úÖ TDD for critical features (auth, payments, mutations)
- ‚úÖ All security checks (RLS, validation, auth)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode
- ‚úÖ Zero ESLint errors
- ‚úÖ Accessibility requirements met

**The difference is PROCESS, not QUALITY:**
- Rapid Mode = Skip bureaucracy, move fast
- Production Mode = Add process for team coordination
- Both modes = Same code quality standards

**Commit format:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(tasks): add task completion toggle

- Added toggle functionality
- Integrated with Supabase
- Added optimistic updates"

# Or if you have an issue:
git commit -m "feat(tasks): add task completion toggle (#123)"
```

---

### üè¢ Production Mode (Stable App / Team / Paying Users)

**When to use:**
- App has paying customers
- Team of 2+ developers
- Stability is critical
- Compliance/audit requirements

**Process:**
1. Create GitHub issue for each feature
2. Create feature branch from `main`
3. Reference issue in branch name: `feature/123-add-task-filter`
4. Make commits with issue reference: `feat(tasks): add task filter (#123)`
5. Open PR when ready
6. Code review required
7. Merge to `main` after approval

**Branch naming:**
```bash
feature/123-add-task-filter
fix/456-task-validation
refactor/789-task-service
```

**Commit format with issue:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(tasks): add task filtering by status (#123)

- Implements user story from #123
- Added comprehensive validation
- Includes unit and integration tests
- Updated documentation"
```

---

### üìå Current Recommendation

**Start with Rapid Mode** ‚Üí Switch to Production Mode when:
- You have first paying customer
- You add a team member
- Stability becomes more important than speed

---

## Iterative Development

Build features in small, testable increments. Each increment should be:
1. **Plannable** - Clear goal and scope
2. **Testable** - Can write tests
3. **Reviewable** - Fits in one PR (if using PRs)
4. **Deployable** - Can ship independently

---

## Feature Development Process (Production Mode)

**Step 1: Plan**
```bash
# Create GitHub issue with:
- User story
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical approach
- Test plan
```

**Step 2: Create Feature Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/123-add-task-filter
```

**Step 3: Implement (TDD approach)**
```bash
# 1. Write types (if needed)
touch features/tasks/types/task-filter.types.ts

# 2. Write validation schema (if needed)
touch features/tasks/validations/task-filter.schema.ts

# 3. Write tests FIRST
touch features/tasks/__tests__/task-filter.test.ts

# 4. Implement service method
# Edit features/tasks/services/task.service.ts

# 5. Write Server Action (if needed)
# Edit features/tasks/actions/task-actions.ts

# 6. Write component tests
touch features/tasks/__tests__/TaskFilter.test.tsx

# 7. Implement UI
touch features/tasks/components/TaskFilter.tsx
```

**Step 4: Validate Quality**
```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Type check
pnpm type-check

# Full validation
pnpm validate  # runs all of the above
```

**Step 5: Commit & Push**
```bash
# Commits trigger pre-commit hooks
git add .

# Production Mode (with issue reference)
git commit -m "feat(tasks): add task filtering by status (#123)"

# Rapid Mode (descriptive message)
git commit -m "feat(tasks): add task filtering with status dropdown"

# Push (adjust branch name based on mode)
git push origin feature/123-add-task-filter  # Production
git push origin main                          # Rapid
```

**Step 6: Pull Request**
- Create PR with description
- Link to GitHub issue
- Request review
- CI runs automatically

**Step 7: Deploy**
- Merge to main ‚Üí auto-deploy to production (Vercel)
- Monitor Sentry for errors
- Check analytics

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming (Production Mode)
```bash
feature/123-add-task-filter     # With issue number
fix/456-task-validation         # Bug fix with issue
refactor/789-task-service       # Refactor with issue
docs/update-readme              # No issue needed for docs
```

### Branch Naming (Rapid Mode)
```bash
main    # Work directly on main
```

### Commit Messages

**Format:** `type(scope): description (#issue)`

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `docs`: Documentation
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples with issue reference (Production Mode):**
```bash
feat(tasks): add task filtering by status (#123)
fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue (#456)
refactor(ui): extract button component (#789)
docs: update API documentation
test(tasks): add task filter tests (#123)
chore: update dependencies
```

**Examples without issue reference (Rapid Mode):**
```bash
feat(tasks): add task filtering by status

- Added filter dropdown with all/active/completed
- Integrated with URL search params
- Added loading states

fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue
refactor(ui): extract button component to shared package
```

**Best Practice for Issue References:**
- Production Mode: **Always include `(#123)`** if issue exists
- Rapid Mode: **Optional** - only if you created an issue for tracking
- Benefits:
  - Automatic linking in GitHub
  - Easy to find related code changes
  - Audit trail for compliance
  - Great for `git log` searching: `git log --grep="#123"`

### Pre-commit Hooks (Husky)

Automatically runs before each commit:
1. ESLint
2. Prettier
3. TypeScript check
4. Unit tests for changed files

---

## Commands Reference

### Development
```bash
# Start all apps
pnpm dev

# Build all
pnpm build
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Quality Checks
```bash
# Lint
pnpm lint
pnpm lint:fix

# Format
pnpm format
pnpm format:check

# Type check
pnpm type-check

# Full validation (pre-commit)
pnpm validate
```

### Database (Supabase + Drizzle)

**Supabase Commands:**
```bash
# Generate TypeScript types from database
pnpm supabase gen types typescript --project-id xxxxx > types/database.ts

# Reset local database
pnpm supabase db reset
```

**Drizzle Migration Workflow (Recommended for Teams):**
```bash
# 1. Update your schema in src/lib/drizzle/schema.ts
# 2. Generate migration files
pnpm drizzle-kit generate

# 3. Review generated SQL in drizzle/migrations/
# 4. Apply migrations to database
pnpm drizzle-kit migrate

# Alternative: Pull existing schema from database
pnpm drizzle-kit introspect
```

**Drizzle Push (Quick iteration, solo dev):**
```bash
# Push schema changes directly without creating migration files
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution - no migration history
pnpm drizzle-kit push
```

**Migration Strategy Decision:**
- **Teams / Production:** Use `generate` ‚Üí `migrate` for version-controlled migrations
- **Solo / Prototyping:** Use `push` for quick iteration
- **Never mix:** Choose one approach per project
